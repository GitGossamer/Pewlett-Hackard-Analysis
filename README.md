# Overview of the analysis:
The following is a summary of our analysis of Pewlett Hackard’s HR review of potential retirees over the next few years and addresses the following deliverables: 
1.	Determine the number of retiring employees per title 
2.	Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program
3.	Write a report that summarizes our analysis and helps prepare our manager for the “silver tsunami”, as many current employees reach retirement age.
## Results: There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. (6 pt)
•	There are 90,398 employees scheduled to retire over the next few years.
•	Of those destined for the ‘silver tsunami’ (aka retirement), as shown in ‘unique_titles.csv’, there are 25,916 Sr. Engineers, 24,926 Sr. Staff, 9,285 Engineers, 7,636 Staff, 3,603 Technique Leaders, 1,090 Asst. Engineers, and 2 Managers.
